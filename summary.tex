\chapter{Conclusion}

This thesis suggests that the underlying structure of perception of the world
around us, the idea that objects, language, and actions exhibit
compositionality, can enable exploring and performing novel and interesting
artificial-intelligence tasks.
%
The work presented herein demonstrates \emph{synthesizing} systems that exhibit
such capability in a variety of domains, from reasoning about complex 3D
assemblies to reasoning about activity recognition.
%
Furthermore, a facet of the work presented demonstrates some exploratory work
in computational neuroscience that supports the thesis from an \emph{analytic}
point of view that the underlying compositional structures that we perceive,
for vision and language, has a neural basis.
